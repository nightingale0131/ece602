This is especially important for robots that need to operate in cluttered environments. The exploration of a solution to this problem by [1] was largely motivated by the problem of finding obstacle-free regions a bi-pedal robot could step on. The proposed algorithm assumes that the environment consists of convex obstacles, which is a reasonable assumption since there are many methods available to decompose obstacles into convex shapes. A high level of detail is not needed. It also assumes that there will be a human operator (or another algorithm) to help select the general location of where this obstacle-free region should be.</p><p>Although we only show the 2D implementation of this algorithm, it is applicable in 3D space as well.</p><h2 id="2">Problem Formulation</h2><p>The general algorithm consists of simultaneously maximizing a polyhedral and an inscribed ellipsoid in the specified location. The polyhedral is composed of the intersection of multiple halfspaces: <img src="main_eq06207615651104457325.png" alt="$P=\{x|Ax\leq b\}$"> and the ellipsoid is represented as an image of an euclidean unit ball: <img src="main_eq13281383093856573215.png" alt="$$\mathcal{E}(C,d)=\{x=C\tilde{x}+d|\|\tilde{x}\|_2\leq 1\} $$">. Given this, we are attempting to solve the following problem:</p><p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="primal_problem.png" alt=""> </p><p>The objective function describes how 'big' the ellipsoid is. By maximizing the inscribed ellipsoid, we are by proxy, maximizing the polyhedral that contains the obstacle-free space. The first constraint prevents the polyhedral from containing any vertices of all obstacles, as none of their vertices should lie in the polyhedral. The second constraint ensures that the ellipsoid does not extend past the polyhedral.</p><h2 id="3">Proposed Solution</h2><p>Instead of directly solving the above problem, which is non-convex, [1] proposes to iteratively find an obstacle-free polyhedral, find the maximal inscribed ellipsoid, and repeat until the ellipsoid no longer grows more than a specified threshold. [1] has nicknamed this procedure as IRIS (Iterative Regional Inflation by Semidefinite Programming). Even though IRIS does not guarantee it will find the largest obstacle-free convex space in a given environment, it does guarantee convergence if the environment is bounded. Because the ellipsoid will not increase past the environment boundaries.</p><p>The solution has two major parts: 1) Find the hyperplanes that separate the given ellipsoid from all the obstacles (resulting in an obstacle-free polyhedral), and 2) find the inscribed ellipsoid in this polyhedral. This procedure will be repeated until the growth of the ellipsoid falls below our specified threshold. Growth is measured by:</p><p><img src="main_eq11089625966227971642.png" alt="$$growth=\frac{\det C_i - \det C_{i-1}}{\det C_{i-1}}$$"></p><p>Where <img src="main_eq06721991517679324891.png" alt="$C_i$"> defines the newly inscribed ellipsoid and <img src="main_eq07846092176802199982.png" alt="$C_{i-1}$"> defines the inscribed ellipsoid from the previous iteration. <img src="main_eq04419372879186140686.png" alt="$\det C$"> is linearly related to the area, thus changes in <img src="main_eq04419372879186140686.png" alt="$\det C$"> is proportional to the change in area of the ellipsoid.</p><p>More details of each portion of the solutions are given in the following sections.</p><h2 id="4">Part 1 - Find separating hyperplanes</h2><p>Given an ellipsoid defined by <img src="main_eq17142497785205038496.png" alt="$Cx+d$">, we need to find the closest point <i>x_star</i> to the ellipsoid from the given set of obstacles, then define a hyperplane that separates the ellipsoid and the obstacle that <i>x_star</i> is on.</p><p>Since the ellipsoid is defined as an image of the unit ball, the inverse of this image can be defined as:</p><p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="transformed_spaces.png" alt=""> </p><p>After this transformation, the closest point on an obstacle to the ellipsoid in the ellipse space, will be the closest point to the origin in the ball space. This problem can be formally constructed in the following way:</p><p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="min_distance_problem.png" alt=""> </p><p>The constraints state that <img src="main_eq07144901297932527568.png" alt="$\tilde{x}$"> must be a convex combination of the vertices in obstacle <img src="main_eq07225361342133155126.png" alt="$j$">.

This results in the optimal point <img src="main_eq10084052107406284721.png" alt="$\tilde{x}^*$">. Then we simply transform it back into the ellipse space using <img src="main_eq18327336225184106839.png" alt="$x^*=C\tilde{x}^*+d$">.</p><p>We define the problem in cvx as follows:</p><pre class="language-matlab">

Even though the original problem is non-convex and complicated, the heuristic is able to turn the complicated problem into a convex optimization problem. Another reason for this efficiency is that we can neglect many redundant obstacles from the environment, using the properties of a convex polygon. This is extremely useful in real-time application such as robot motion planning.</p><p>The main disadvantage of this method is that it cannot guarantee that the returned solution is the largest, convex, obstacle-free region in the environment. However, for most non-convex optimization problems, it is very difficult to find the optimal solution. One thing to note is that the algorithm requires good initialization. In applications such as unmanned aerial vehicle path planning, we first need to compute the convex region to generate a good trajectory for the robot. Since the area is expanded without direction, this means that even though the algorithm can find a large convex region in the space,it may not be the largest space in the entire map since our algorithm depends on the initial point.</p><h2 id="13">References</h2><p>[1] R.

%% Computing Large Convex Regions of Obstacle-Free Space through SemiDefinite Programming
% Report written by: Buu Phan and Florence Tsang
%% Introduction to the Problem
% In path planners for robots, it is often advantageous to be able to quickly identify
% large regions of obstacle free space that the robot can freely move
% through. This is especially important for robots that need to operate in
% cluttered environments. The exploration of a solution to this problem by
% [1] was largely motivated by the problem of finding obstacle-free regions
% a bi-pedal robot could step on.
% The proposed algorithm assumes that the environment consists of convex
% obstacles, which is a reasonable assumption since there are many methods
% available to decompose obstacles into convex shapes. A high level of
% detail is not needed. It also assumes that there will be a human operator
% (or another algorithm)
% to help select the general location of where this obstacle-free region
% should be.
%
% Although we only show the 2D implementation of this algorithm, it is applicable in 3D
% space as well.
%% Problem Formulation
% The general algorithm consists of simultaneously maximizing a polyhedral
% and an inscribed ellipsoid in the specified location.
% The polyhedral is composed of the intersection of multiple halfspaces:
% $P=\{x|Ax\leq b\}$ and the ellipsoid is represented as an image of an
% euclidean unit ball: $$\mathcal{E}(C,d)=\{x=C\tilde{x}+d|\|\tilde{x}\|_2\leq
% 1\} $$. Given this, we are attempting to solve the following problem:
%
% <<primal_problem.png>>
%
% The objective function describes how 'big' the ellipsoid is. By
% maximizing the inscribed ellipsoid, we are by proxy, maximizing the
% polyhedral that contains the obstacle-free space.
% The first constraint prevents the polyhedral from containing any vertices
% of all obstacles, as none of their vertices should lie in the polyhedral.
% The second constraint ensures that the ellipsoid does not extend past the
% polyhedral.
%% Proposed Solution
% Instead of directly solving the above problem, which is non-convex, [1] proposes to
% iteratively find an obstacle-free polyhedral, find the maximal inscribed
% ellipsoid, and repeat until the ellipsoid no longer grows more than a
% specified threshold. [1] has nicknamed this procedure as IRIS (Iterative Regional
% Inflation by Semidefinite Programming). Even though IRIS does not guarantee it will find
% the largest obstacle-free convex space in a given environment, it does guarantee
% convergence if the environment is bounded. Because the ellipsoid will not increase past
% the environment boundaries. 
%
% The solution has two major parts: 1) Find the hyperplanes that separate
% the given ellipsoid from all the obstacles (resulting in an obstacle-free
% polyhedral), and 2) find the inscribed ellipsoid in this polyhedral.
% This procedure will be repeated until the growth of the ellipsoid falls below our
% specified threshold. Growth is measured by:
%
% $$growth=\frac{\det C_i - \det C_{i-1}}{\det C_{i-1}}$$
%
% Where $C_i$ defines the newly inscribed ellipsoid and $C_{i-1}$ defines the inscribed
% ellipsoid from the previous iteration. $\det C$ is linearly related to the area, thus
% changes in $\det C$ is proportional to the change in area of the ellipsoid. 
%
% More details of each portion of the solutions are given in the following sections.
%
%%% Part 1 - Find separating hyperplanes
% Given an ellipsoid defined by $Cx+d$, we need to find the closest point _x_star_ to
% the ellipsoid from the given set of obstacles, then define a hyperplane that separates
% the ellipsoid and the obstacle that _x_star_ is on. 
%
% Since the ellipsoid is defined as an
% image of the unit ball, the inverse of this image can be defined as:
% 
% <<transformed_spaces.png>>
%
% After this transformation, the closest point on an obstacle to the ellipsoid in the
% ellipse space,
% will be the closest point to the origin in the ball space. This problem can be
% formally constructed in the following way:
%
% <<min_distance_problem.png>>
%
% The constraints state that $\tilde{x}$ must be a convex combination of the
% vertices in obstacle $j$. It ensures that $\tilde{x}$ must be in the closure of
% obstacle $j$ while minimizing the norm of $\tilde{x}$. This results in the optimal
% point $\tilde{x}^*$. Then we simply transform it back into the ellipse space using
% $x^*=C\tilde{x}^*+d$.     
%
% We define the problem in cvx as follows:
%
% <include>ClosestPointOnObstacle.m</include>
% 
% The hyperplane that separates the obstacle and the ellipsoid must only intersect the
% boundary of obstacle $j$ and be tangent to the ellipsoid. The simplest way to
% calculate this is to consider the following representation of the ellipsoid:
%
% $$\mathcal{E}=\{x|(x-d)^T C^{-1} C^{-1} (x-d) \leq 1\} $$.
% 
% Then $a_j$ of the hyperplane is the gradient of the ellipsoid's barrier function at
% $x^*$:
%
% $$a_j=2C^{-1}C^{-1}(x^*-d)$$
% 
% Once $a_j$ is known, $b_j$ can be calculated as:
%
% $$b_j=a_j^T x^*$$
%
% In practice, it is not necessary to calculate the separating hyperplane of every
% obstacle, the algorithm employs a few techniques to optimize the process:
%
% * we run the solver for the above problem on the closest obstacle to the ellipsoid
% first
% * then after calculating the separating hyperplane, we exclude all the obstacles
% that are also separated from the ellipse by this hyperplane, before calculating the
% next hyperplane for the next closest obstacle
%
% From the above procedure, we find that not very many hyperplanes are needed to
% create an obstacle-free region. In our experiments, we have 80 obstacles and usually
% less than 10 hyperplanes are calculated. This matches the observation that [1] made
% about the number of hyperplanes needed.
%%% Part 2 - Calculate the inscribed ellipsoid
% Now that we have an obstacle-free polyhedral region, we must calculate
% the inscribed ellipsoid. This problem can be constructed as:
%
% <<inscribed_ellipsoid.png>>
%
% We solved this problem using CVX. However, CVX cannot efficiently solve
% $\log \det C$ and the user guide [2] recommended using the det_rootn
% function instead: 
%
%   % Calculate the inscribed ellipsoid
%   sizeA = size(A);
%   n = sizeA(2);
%   m = sizeA(1);
%   cvx_begin quiet
%       variable C(n,n) symmetric
%       variable d(n)
%       maximize( det_rootn( C ) )
%       subject to            
%          for j = 1:m
%              norm( C*A(j,:)', 2 ) + A(j,:)*d <= b(j);
%          end
%   cvx_end
%% Data Synthesis
% To illustrate the solution, we randomly generate triangles in a bounded space to simulate our
% environment with <../generateTestdata.m generateTestdata.m>. Triangles are convex, and many convex shapes can be further
% broken down into triangles. A sample environment is shown below.
%
% We then select a spot, $d_0$ where we would like the
% obstacle-free region to be. The initial ellipsoid is a circle with a small
% radius around the specified coordinates.

% This portion of the code converts the output of generateTestdata into a usable
% format for further processing.

%% Analysis and Conclusions
% The advantages of this method is that it is computationally efficient. Even though the original problem is non-convex and complicated, the heuristic is able to turn the complicated problem into a convex optimization problem. 
% Another reason for this efficiency is that we can neglect many redundant obstacles from the environment, using the properties of a convex polygon. This is extremely useful in real-time application such as robot motion planning. 
%  
% The main disadvantage of this method is that it cannot guarantee that the returned solution is the largest, convex, obstacle-free region in the environment. However, for most non-convex optimization problems, it is very difficult to find the optimal solution. 
% One thing to note is that the algorithm requires good initialization. In applications such as unmanned aerial vehicle path planning, we first need to compute the convex region to generate a good trajectory for the robot. Since the
% area is expanded without direction, this means that even though the algorithm can find a large convex region in the space,it may not be the largest space in the entire map since our algorithm depends on the initial point.
